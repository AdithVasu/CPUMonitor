**CPU Monitor**
Like a dashboard for your car, this app provides real-time and historical data on your server's performance, helping you monitor key metrics and stay ahead of potential issues.


**Overview**

This app provides a comprehensive suite of tools for monitoring a server's health:

Real-time Metrics: Displays live data for CPU usage, memory utilization, disk usage, and network I/O, streamed via WebSockets.

Historical Data: Collects and stores performance metrics in an InfluxDB time-series database for long-term analysis and visualization.

Automated Alerts: Triggers alerts to a Discord channel when specific resource thresholds (e.g., CPU, memory) are exceeded, ensuring you are notified of critical events.

System Information: Provides detailed information about the system's processes, hardware (CPU cores, memory), and network connections.

Intuitive Dashboard: A modern, single-page dashboard built with React and interactive charts for easy monitoring.

**Technologies**

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Node.js)

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Libraries: react, react-router-dom, systeminformation, socket.io, dotenv, axios

APIs & Protocols: Socket.IO (for real-time communication), InfluxDB Client API, Discord Webhooks

Database: InfluxDB
